Of course that means the aftermarket is full of things to make an UTV better. Today on GEARZ, Stacey takes a Polaris Ranger and decks it out with a 3 ½” lift, bigger tires and axles, winches front and rear, and all kinds of other cool things to build an all-terrain vehicle that will really shine on the trail or off.

The car was originally called the Schultz El Fierro but it’s officially titled in New Jersey as a “Schultz Special” from 1958. It was used to drag race and held numerous racing records, but most important to the family was that it was driven by the legendary Carroll Shelby. With a frame and style much similar to the Shelby Roadster, the Schultz family wonders if it inspired one of the most well known automobiles in America. In another epic New Jersey story, Ray finds Mario Andretti’s 1965 IndyCar. The catch: it’s completely in pieces hidden away in a garage. The iconic driver talks about his days on the track with that car and Ray attempts to negotiate a deal to buy the parts.</desc><category lang="en">Sports</category></programme>
